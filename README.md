# 📦 Inventory Management System (Text File Based)

## 📌 Project Overview
This is a **Python-based Inventory Management System** that manages inventory records using **text files** instead of a database.  
The project includes a **custom Python library (`txt_file_lib.py`)** for handling read and write operations.

It also supports **bill generation**, where bills are **printed on screen and saved as PDF files** with a **unique invoice number**.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Custom file-handling library
- Persistent data storage using text files
- Menu-driven console interface
- PDF bill generation with invoice number
- Simple and beginner-friendly design

---

## 🛠️ System Functionalities
The system provides the following **7 menu options**:

1. **Add Items**  
   Add new products to the inventory.

2. **Update Items**  
   Update existing product details such as name, quantity, or price.

3. **Delete Items**  
   Remove items permanently from the inventory.

4. **View Inventory**  
   Display all inventory items stored in the text file.

5. **Search Item**  
   Search for an item using item name or item ID.

6. **Bill Generation**  
   - Generates a customer bill  
   - Calculates total amount  
   - Displays bill on screen  
   - Saves bill as a **PDF file**  
   - Uses a **unique invoice number**

7. **Exit**  
   Safely exits the system.

## 📂 Project Structure

---

## 🧩 Custom Library: `txt_file_lib.py`
The `txt_file_lib.py` file is a user-defined Python library that performs:
- Reading data from text files
- Writing data to text files
- Updating inventory records
- Deleting inventory records

This makes the project **modular, reusable, and well-structured**.

---

## 🧾 Bill & PDF Generation
- Bills are generated with a **unique invoice number**
- Each bill is saved as a **PDF**
- Useful for record keeping and printing

---

## 💻 Technologies Used
- Python
- File Handling (Text Files)
- PDF Generation Library (FPDF / ReportLab)
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

---

## 🎯 Use Cases
- College mini project
- Learning Python file handling
- Understanding custom Python libraries
- Small shop or store inventory simulation

---

## 🏁 Conclusion
This project demonstrates how an **Inventory Management System** can be built using Python with **custom file handling, modular programming, and PDF billing**, without using a database.
